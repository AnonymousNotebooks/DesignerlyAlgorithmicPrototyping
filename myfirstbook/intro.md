# Plenty in The Pantry | Algorithmic Prototyping Notebooks

This book is part of a paper titled: "Plenty in the Pantry: A Designer's Exploration into Longer Term Algorithmic Prototyping for Machine Learning Applications". THis book provides detailed insights into how the authors algoritmically prototyped a longer term machine learning application for automated grocery shopping. We did so from the viewpoint of a designer, who is not trained in data science and machine learning. The aim of this paper and these notebooks is to help designers/design researchers to explore how they might further their insights into the possibilities for prototyping for (longer term) machine learning applications.

The notebooks in this book correlate to the six-step approach as described in the paper (see figure below). The notebooks are numbered accordingly.
