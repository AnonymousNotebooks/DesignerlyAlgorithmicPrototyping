# Designerly Algorithmic Prototyping | Notebooks

This Jupyter book is part of a paper titled: "Bridging Everyday Life and Machine Learning through Designerly Algorithmic
Prototyping: An Exploratory Case Study on Grocery Shopping". This book provides detailed insights into how the authors algoritmically prototyped a longer term machine learning application for automated grocery shopping. We did so from the viewpoint of a designer, who is not trained in data science and machine learning. The aim of this paper and these notebooks is to help designers/design researchers to explore how they might further their insights into the possibilities for prototyping for (longer term) machine learning applications.

The notebooks in this book correspond with the six-step process as described in the paper (see figure below). The notebooks are numbered accordingly. 

These notebooks make use of dummy data that is inspired by the data that was collected from the households in the grocery automation case study.
